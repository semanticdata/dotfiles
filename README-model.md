## Requirements

Before using the theme, you need to install [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) ≥ 0.17.2.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone git@github.com:semanticdata/[this-repo].git
cd [this-repo]
zola serve
# open http://127.0.0.1:1111/ in the browser
```

## Customization

You can customize your configurations, templates and content for yourself. Look at the `config.toml`, and templates files in this repo for an idea.

In most cases you only need to modify the content in the `config.toml` file to
customize your blog.

### Custom CSS styles

Adding your custom css is as easy as adding your own styles to the `sass/_custom.scss` file.

## Useful Commands

| Command                    | Description                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `zola build`               | Build only                 |
| `zola serve`               | Build and Serve            |
